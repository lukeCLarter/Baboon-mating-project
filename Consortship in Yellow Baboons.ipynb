    "### Male Reproductive Success\n",
    "For males of sexually reproducing species, mating access to females is a crucial factor shaping each individual’s reproductive success (Bateman, 1948). When females are monopolizable by males during their most likely time of conception, males compete intensely for access to females (Andersson, 1994). Yellow baboon females exhibit conspicuous sexual swellings when fertile (Wildt et al., 1977), and become fertile asynchronously, allowing dominant males to effectively monopolize them when conception is most likely. This results in a positive correlation between male rank and reproductive success (Alberts, Buchan, & Altmann, 2006). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consortship\n",
    "Consortship is a highly successful strategy for male baboons. A form of mate guarding, the male will maintain proximity to a fertile female for hours or days, mating with her and detering other males from mating with her (Seyfarth 1978).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Purpose\n",
    "We will investigate consortship behaviour both in terms of male motivation to consort, and constraints on males’ ability to engage in consortship. This will allow us to more fully understand the factors shaping male reproductive tactics, and ultimately give us a clearer idea of how sexual selection functions in primates, and in animals more broadly.

    "## The Data\n",
    "The dataset is from a study by Tung et al. (2012) on baboon mating, comprised of observing eight groups of baboons from 1980 to 2007. They recorded whether they observed mating (1/0) or consortship (1/0) between each male-female pair during that female baboon's fertile window. Tung et al.'s study focused on genetic effects on mating, while our focus is on consortships.\n",

    "### Male Rank vs Proportion of Consortships Formed / Matings; Chosen method\n",
    "Because the presence of consortship is a categorical variable (1 or 0) for each male during each individual female cycle, and we wanted to see if there was a linear relationship between a male's rank and his consort success, I had to turn this into a continuous variable. We did this by looking at the proportion of cycles in which a male consorted (described below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Male ranks change over time often from cycle to cycle, so when using consortship proportion (which is a summary measure over several cycles), there are often multiple rank values for each individual male. As such, I clustered all male's ranks and then calculated a consortship proportion (# consortships / # cycles where that male mated) for each male, for each cluster they appeared in; e.g. male 1 would have a consortship proportion computed from all of the cycles he mated in while his rank placed him in cluster 1, and then a different consortship proportion for when his rank placed him in cluster 2 etc. Then I plotted the relationship between rank-cluster number and consortship proportion. Thus, each male is represented, at-maximum once in each cluster, though some males are represented in multiple clusters when they occupied ranks from multiple clusters over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above method was chosen to reduce pseudo-replication (males may be represented multiple times, but only when they appear in different clusters), to avoid imposing any arbitrary clusters on the rank data, as well as to allow consortship success to become a continuous variable (to create a proportion it is necesarry to be able to group male mating events, in this case via male rank-cluster). What we are left with is a continuous variable (consortship success), plotted against an ordinal variable (rank-cluster)."

However, female sexual swellings are a only a probabilistic signal of fertility (Nunn, 1999); females have evolved to give imperfect information to males as a means of breaking male monopoly.

    "\n",
    "As consortship is costly to males in terms of time, energy, and lost opportunities (Alberts et al., 1996), we would expect males to only engage in consortship when the potential benefits are greatest. For example, benefits can change with female age, as the probability of conception for female baboons is highest around age 14 (Tung et al., 2012). As consortships are intended to prevent other males from having access to the female, we would also expect that some males are unable to mate with females who are experiencing being consorted. The following questions serve to investigate these effects:\n",
    "- Does the presence of a consort affect the proportion of males in the group that the female is able to mate with during her cycle?\n",

We would expect that the males that formed consortships mated with the female more often than the other males in the group, but by looking at the proportion of males mated with we can see that the other males were still able to access the female at least once.\n",

Females that had no consorts have a wider spread of the proportions of males mated with, and some have very low proportions (indicated they mated with very few different males). It's possible that these females were less desirable to the males for a variety of reasons, such as their rank or age (less likely to concieve). If fewer males were competing for access, there benefits of forming a consortship wouldn't be as strong. Female mate choice refers to the female choosing which males they want to mate with, and could be another reason behind a lower proportion."

    "\n",
    "From visually inspecting the data, we can conclude that:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Rank has a positive relationship with consortship ability, and this relationship does not differ between conceptive and non-conceptive cycles, perhaps indicating that males have imperfect information on female fertility and so can't target conceptive cycles with a great degree of accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "-Females with consorts were still able to mate with a high proportion of the males in their group\n",
    "\n",
    "-The female’s age did not seem to affect her likelihood of being consorted\n",
    "\n",
    "-There were slightly more consortships during conceptive cycles compared with non-conceptive cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further exploration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Female rank, rank interact, and genetics.** Using this dataset other models could look into the effects of female rank, and the interaction between male and female rank, on consortship. There is also genetic data availiable that measures relatedness and hybridization.\n",
    "- **Length of the consortship.** As consortships can last for hours to days, a future study could look into what influence investing more/less time in consortship has on male reproductive success. Additionally, it could investigate whether conceptive cycles receiver longer consortships.\n",
    "- **Number of matings.** Many female baboons mated with a high proportion of the availiable males in their group. Recording the exact number of times a male was able to mate with the female could show the effectiveness of consortships more clearly than a presenece/absence measure.\n",
    "- **Paternity if the female did conceive.** Using genetic data, it would be interesting to see how consortship or number of copulations determines which male sires a female's offspring.\n",
    "- **Number of females cycling.** It would also be interesting to see how the number of females cycling at the same time influences how males allocate their consortship effort among these females and, if they prioritize some females over others, which characteristics of females they use to make this judgement.\n",
    "- **Baboon Geo-location / weather data.** Having the geo location data for the baboons could have aided in visualizing their location on maps and help evaluate environmental impact on consortships."
